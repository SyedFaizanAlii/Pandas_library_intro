# Pandas_library_intro
Pandas is a Python library widely used for data manipulation and analysis. While it primarily focuses on working with in-memory data, it also offers functionality to interact with databases. With Pandas, you can easily read data from various database systems into DataFrames, perform data manipulation and analysis, and write the results back to the database. This versatility makes Pandas a valuable tool for working with database data in Python, whether you're analyzing large datasets or integrating database operations into your data science workflows.
